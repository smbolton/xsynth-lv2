Xsynth-LV2
++++++++++

This is a quick port of `Xsynth-DSSI`_ to `LV2`_ to familiarize myself with
the current state of LV2.

.. _Xsynth-DSSI: http://dssi.sourceforge.net/download.html
.. _LV2: http://lv2plug.in/

Currently (3/4/2017) the following are working:

* Sound synthesis
* GUI patch editor

The following are not implemented:

* Presets
* Test note widgets
* Any of the configuration settings other than 'Tuning': polyphony, mono mode,
  glide mode, or pitch bend range.

See the `Xsynth-DSSI README`_ for more information on the original Xsynth-DSSI.
